# cpp-utils
Hey! This repository holds collection of solutions to practice problems around Data Structures and Algorithm.

Along with problem solution, there are segregated utilities around different type of algorithms which are well documented

## What this Repository isn't (yet)
It is not a plug and play library, hell its not even compilable as of now!

## What it needs to become
The aim is to learn how to package a library in C++ along with having updated DSA notes.
